  Just an internal to do list of things I might forget. This isn't
  an official to do list - lots of features obviously needed aren't
  listed here.

  - In PHPLog, check if config file is newer than stored entry
  - Locks!
  - sh wrappers; wrapper for PLParser.php in order to allow starting
    as a daemon;
  - RPM
