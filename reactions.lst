# PHPLog custom reaction verbs list
# $Id: reactions.lst,v 1.1 2002/12/19 18:59:20 bogdan Exp $

# Lines starting with "#" are ignored; empty lines
# are ignored; spaces at the beginning and end of lines
# are ignored; everything is case sensitive.

# List reaction verbs here, one per line, no other
# informaion needed.

# For instance, if you wanted to create a plugin to send
# data via ssh with the following format:
# sshSend host="<host>" format="<format>"
# then the line you'd want to add here would look like
# sshSend

# Of course, you'd also have to write the code to actually
# react to that. You would probably want to do that in
# include/classes/PL_Plugin.php so the next version of
# PHPLog won't overwrite your changes (which would happen
# if you were to implement your code in PL_Executor.php)
